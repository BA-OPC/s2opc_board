This folder contains one unique certificate which is designed to be used as both root CA certificate or leaf certificate (client/server application). 
Indeed a end-entity certificate could be a root CA for OPC UA protocol backward interoperability (see OPC UA spec. part 6).
If you want to use this certificate as a root CA, the leaf application certificate must be directly issued by this root (because of pathLen 0).
